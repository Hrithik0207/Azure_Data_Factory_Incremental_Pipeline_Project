1- Developed and orchestrated an incremental data pipeline in Azure Data Factory (ADF) to efficiently load and synchronize new and updated data.

2 - Implemented a watermark-based approach using Lookup activities to track and retrieve only the last modified data from the source.

3 - Automated the data flow by copying data from the landing zone to a staging area, ensuring data integrity before loading it into the final destination.

4- Managed and maintained the pipeline's state by updating the watermark using Stored Procedures, ensuring data consistency and preventing redundant data ingestion.
